# Sample Scoring Walkthrough — Parent/Guardian Letter Project

This document demonstrates how the evaluation rubric is applied to a single test case.

The purpose is to show the evaluation process, not to present an idealized or optimized output.

## Test Case

**Case ID:** EPL-003

**Input Snapshot:**
```json
{
  "student_grade": "4",
  "attendance_rate": "88%",
  "behavior_notes": "No behavioral incidents recorded.",
  "teacher_notes": "Frequent disruptions during independent work time."
}
## Example Model Output (Excerpt)

The generated letter includes the following grounded statements:

> “Attendance records indicate an attendance rate of 88%, which reflects the information provided.  
>  
> Behavioral notes indicate no recorded incidents; however, teacher observations note frequent disruptions during independent work time. Both points are acknowledged without additional interpretation.  
>  
> Academic performance metrics were not provided in the available data and are therefore not discussed.”

This excerpt is representative of the full output and is sufficient for rubric-based evaluation.
